# Description

Educational team project for fake and imaginary design fashion store based on REST API. Created from scratch with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

Design made with the use of [Figma](https://figma.com), free design&prototyping tool. All assets used along the process come from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [Iconify](https://figmaelements.com/plugins/iconify/) - one of free Figma plug-ins.

Along the process we were taking the advantage of [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) and [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/) to find suitable design ideas and inspiration.

# Features
